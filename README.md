## Class name syntax

The folowing code shows the specification for the syntax of the class names in Leptons.

```
[!]module[-attribute]-value[:pseudoClass][::pseudoElement][-media]
```
* `[]` brackets means optional.
  So, any class requires as minimun the module name and the value.
  Example: In `p-1px`, the character `p` represents the Padding module and `1px`  is the value. So this is builded as `.p-1px { padding: 1px; }`
* `module` the module name.
  Example: In `f-s-9px`, the character `f` represents the Font module, so this is builded as `.f-s-12px { font-size: 9px; }`
* `attribute` the attribute of the module to set.
  Example: in `m-t-8px`, `s` is the Top attribute of the Margin module, so this is builded as `.m-t-8px { margin-top: 8px; }`
* `value` the value assigned to the attribute.
  Example: in `t-a-c`, `c` is the value assigned to the Align attribute of the Text module, so this is builded as `.t-a-c { text-align: center; }`
* `pseudoClass` one or multiple CSS pseudo classes assigned to the class.
Example: in `t-dl-u:h`, `:h` represents the `:hover` css pseudo class, so this is builded as `.t-dl-u\:h:hover { text-decoration-line: underline; }`
* `!` the symbol to represent the `!important` modifier in CSS.
  Example: `!p-1px` is builded as `.\!p-1px { padding: 1px !important; }`


## Type of values

* Character(s): a lowercase letter or combination of them.

  Examples:

  * `c` in `t-a-c` is the `center` value for the `align` attribute of the Text module
  * `lt` in `t-dl-u` is the `underline` value for the `decoration-line` attribute of the Text module

  Characters, generally, have an equivalent long version name.
  Example:

  * `t-a-c` can be written as `t-a-center`
  * `t-dl-lt` can be written as `t-dl-lineThrough`

  As you see in the example above, camelCase convention is used when the long name is composed for two or more words.

* Length:  a number followed by the type of length.
  Examples:

  * `12px` in `p-l-12px` is the  `12` value expressed in pixels for the Left attribute of the Padding module.
  * `1p` in `m-t-1p` is the value 1 expressed in Percentage for the Top attribute of the Margin module.

* Color: some attributes of some modules uses a color name as values. The name of the color must be defined in the `leptons.yaml` configuration file.
Examples:

  * `black` in `t-c-black` is the value for the `black` entry defined in the `colors` collection of the config file `leptons.yaml`

* Font: some attributes of some modules uses a color name as values. The name of the color must be defined in the `leptons.yaml` configuration file.
  Examples:

  * `black` in `t-c-black` is the value for the `black` entry defined in the `colors` collection of the config file `leptons.yaml`

* Font: some attributes of some modules uses a color name as values. The name of the color must be defined in the `leptons.yaml` configuration file.
  Examples:

  * `black` in `t-c-black` is the value for the `black` entry defined in the `colors` collection of the config file `leptons.yaml`
